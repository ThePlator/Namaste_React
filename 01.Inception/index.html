1) What is CDN?
-> A content delivery network (CDN) is geographically group of servers that caches content close to end users. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading internet content, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

The popularity of CDN servies continues to grow, and today the majority of web traffic is served through CDNs, including traffic from major sites like Facebook, Netflix  and Amazon.

A properly configured CDN may also help protect websites against some common malicious attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks.
